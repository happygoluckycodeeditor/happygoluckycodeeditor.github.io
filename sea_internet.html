        <p class="sea_body body_padding"> The following term paper of master's course looks into the spread of ICT technologies and internet
        and their influence on the local economy of South-East Asian Countries (Particularly ASEAN Countries)
        </p>

        <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
        <p class="sea_body body_padding">The paper discusses the impact of Internet and social media on Society and Economic Development.
            It highlights the role of internet in promoting economic growth and incresing communication accessibility. The paper also
            raises the hypothesis of whether Internet Penetration correlates with Economic Development in different south-east asian countries and 
            their infrastructures. The paper uses a quantitative approach, specifically simple linear regression, to verify the correlation between GDP and economic development and social media in different ASEAN member states. The paper also examines the trends between GDP, social media, and economic development over a period of 7/8 years. The data and discussion aim to provide insights into how GDP has impacted the emergence of the Internet and social media over the years.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Importance of Internet and Social Media</span></h2>
        <p class="sea_body body_padding">The internet and social media have been a groundbreaking innovation
            which has contributed to exceptional growth to many world economies. While Internet penetration has been linked to economic growth, 
            the timing and reach of its adoption varies based on socio-political and economic factors. 
            Social media platforms, on the other hand, have experienced explosive growth over the past two decades and 
            have become a significant factor in commerce and political change.
            <br>
            Social media and internet has changed the world. The rapid and vast adoption of these 
            technologies is changing how we find partners, how we access information from the 
            news, and how we organize to demand political change. And thus, it is important to study and research their tendencies with regards to
            different regional factors.
