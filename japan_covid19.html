    <h3 class="term_paper_title">日本の水際対策の有効性（ケーススタディ）</h3>

    <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        This article and paper looks into understanding the effectiveness of border closure and border restrictions put up by Government of Japan throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic until 2022 and
        check for it's effectiveness
    </p>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p class="sea_body body_padding">Japan just like almost all the countries in this world experienced a wave COVID19 infections in 2020 which they tried to control the spread of. However, in order to stop further spread of the virus, Japan adopted to close their borders and a state of emergency inside the country.
        Japan has since implemented a lot of state of emergencies and has promoted it's effectiveness.
        <br>
        However, it is actually the case? This article looks deeper into this method and policies and checks how effective border restrictions and they relate to other methods of stopping rise in COVID19 infections
     </p>

     <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Spread of COVID-19 and measures by different countries and Japan</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        Initial cases of COVID19 first started appearing in the year of 2019, which were then followed by a series of strict survelliance measures which were then followed by recommendations for people to quarantine for
        symptoms of cold and cough.
        <br>
        However, the Government of Japan decided to enact a state of emergency in March 2020 followed by rising cases of COVID-19 all over the world.
        This was followed by a complete border restriction in Japan.
     </p>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        Similar to Japan, many countries also took similar measures to minimise the level of spread of the infection.
     </p>

     <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Japan's State of emergencies</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">It is important to know that lockdowns in Japan work differently compared to Other countries.
        As a matter of fact, Japan does not even have the concept of Complete lockdowns where the movement of an individual is completely halted or restricted. Instead, the government suggests
        its citizen refrain from Travelling. This is because the constitution of Japan does not allow completement restriction of movement of its residents.
        <br>
        <p class="sea_body lower_pad">Japan's state of emergencies are similar to lockdown however, they are merely a set of suggestions and recommendations which are expected to be followed by the residents of the country.
            State of emergencies were quite effective at the start of the pandemic however, they eventually lost their effectiveness as time progressed with their repetitive enactions.
        </p>
     </p>

     <h2 class="underline sea_body"><span>Border Restrictions</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">Japan's border restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic stirred controversy when they were announced. Being one of the first countries to detect the virus on its mainland, Japan took the measure of blocking travelers from over 70 nations. The border closure began on April 3, 2020, as a preventive measure to avoid the spread of infections. By July 24 of the same year, Japan had banned people from 150 different nations, aiming to keep infected individuals from entering the country. However, these restrictions were criticized for not being comprehensive, as Japanese citizens faced no obstacles while foreign residents, including students and workers, were denied entry. The inconsistent execution of the restrictions allowed more infections to enter the country, undermining their effectiveness and leading to their failure.</p>

     <!-- Add one more section of Literature review explaining border restrictions here as well-->

     <h2 class="sea_body underline body"><span>Proposed Hypotheis and observations</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">Based on the info raised above, the paper/articile raised the following questions:
     </p>

     <ol class="sea_body">
        <li>Was Japan's State of Emergencies effective? If yes, how?</li>
        <li>Was Japan's Border Restrictions sufficient enough to stop the spread of COVID19 inside Japan?</li>
     </ol>

     <p class="sea_body body_padding">To the above raised research questions, the article proposed the following hypothesis on the basis of 
        previous literature and theoretical framework
     </p>

     <ol class="sea_body lower_pad">
        <li>H<sub>1</sub>: State of Emergencies were initally quite effective in preventing the spread of virus however, due to Pandemic fatigue the 
        effectiveness eventually faded away</li>
        <li>H<sub>2</sub>: Border Restrictions did not have a good impact on the spread of the virus inside the country because the policies were not consistent with the entry of personnel in the Country</li>
     </ol>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Observations and Insights</span></h2>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline upper_pad"><span>Review and Conclusions</span></h2>
    <p class="sea_body body_padding">Japan's implementation of lockdowns and border restrictions during the pandemic proved ineffective in the long run. Despite four states of emergency, the virus continued to spread. Closing the borders had a negative impact on Japan's public image, leading to high daily spikes in COVID-19 cases. Criticism arose from domestic and international institutions, yet Japan's government remained steadfast in its measures. Domestic support for border closures played a role in the government's decisions, despite scientific evidence against their effectiveness. Relief packages aimed at mitigating the economic impact faced challenges among Japanese citizens, foreign residents, and non-residents. Discriminatory measures banning foreign residents were heavily criticized globally and created uncertainty for prospective migrants. Future research should focus on the social impact of lockdowns and the consequences of barring prospective foreign residents. Evidence-based policies informed by scientific research are essential for managing crises effectively.</p>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Limitations</span></h2>
    <p class="sea_body body_padding">The paper’s research is based mainly on secondary research, which can have its inherent drawbacks of outdated or static data. Due to geographical constraints, however, the paper also fails to not primary data such as a survey on perceptions of Japanese people concerning border restrictions which would have supplemented in finding out more insightful reasoning behind the sentiment of border restrictions. Moreover, by nature of the topic, the paper focuses only on Japan and, for the most part, looks at the predicaments of Japan’s Pandemic efforts. As a result, it fails to address or compare Japan’s statistics and actions against other nations. Doing so could help understand Japan’s actions on a deeper comparative level.</p>

    <h2 class="sea_body" style="text-align: center;"><span>Thank you so much for going through the paper!</span></h2>
