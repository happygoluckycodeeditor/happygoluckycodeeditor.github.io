    <h3 class="term_paper_title">日本の水際対策の有効性（ケーススタディ）</h3>

    <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        This article and paper looks into understanding the effectiveness of border closure and border restrictions put up by Government of Japan throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic until 2022 and
        check for it's effectiveness
    </p>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p class="sea_body body_padding">Japan just like almost all the countries in this world experienced a wave COVID19 infections in 2020 which they tried to control the spread of. However, in order to stop further spread of the virus, Japan adopted to close their borders and a state of emergency inside the country.
        Japan has since implemented a lot of state of emergencies and has promoted it's effectiveness.
        <br>
        However, it is actually the case? This article looks deeper into this method and policies and checks how effective border restrictions and they relate to other methods of stopping rise in COVID19 infections
     </p>

     <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Spread of COVID-19 and measures by different countries and Japan</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        Initial cases of COVID19 first started appearing in the year of 2019, which were then followed by a series of strict survelliance measures which were then followed by recommendations for people to quarantine for
        symptoms of cold and cough.
        <br>
        However, the Government of Japan decided to enact a state of emergency in March 2020 followed by rising cases of COVID-19 all over the world.
        This was followed by a complete border restriction in Japan.
     </p>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">
        Similar to Japan, many countries also took similar measures to minimise the level of spread of the infection.
     </p>

     <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Japan's State of emergencies</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">It is important to know that lockdowns in Japan work differently compared to Other countries.
        As a matter of fact, Japan does not even have the concept of Complete lockdowns where the movement of an individual is completely halted or restricted. Instead, the government suggests
        its citizen refrain from Travelling. This is because the constitution of Japan does not allow completement restriction of movement of its residents.
        <br>
        <p class="sea_body lower_pad">Japan's state of emergencies are similar to lockdown however, they are merely a set of suggestions and recommendations which are expected to be followed by the residents of the country. To give a perspective on this issue, here's a table to look into the comparison of Japan's policies v/s the world:</p>
     </p>

     <!-- Add a table here as soon as possible-->

     <!-- Add one more section of Literature review explaining border restrictions here as well-->

     <h2 class="sea_body underline body"><span>Proposed Hypotheis and observations</span></h2>
     <p class="sea_body body_padding">Based on the info raised above, the paper/articile raised the following questions:
     </p>

     <ol class="sea_body">
        <li>Was Japan's State of Emergencies effective? If yes, how?</li>
        <li>Was Japan's Border Restrictions sufficient enough to stop the spread of COVID19 inside Japan?</li>
     </ol>

     <p class="sea_body body_padding">To the above raised research questions, the article proposed the following hypothesis on the basis of 
        previous literature and theoretical framework
     </p>

     <ol class="sea_body lower_pad">
        <li>H<sub>1</sub>: State of Emergencies were initally quite effective in preventing the spread of virus however, due to Pandemic fatigue the 
        effectiveness eventually faded away</li>
        <li>H<sub>2</sub>: Border Restrictions did not have a good impact on the spread of the virus inside the country because the policies were not consistent with the entry of personnel in the Country</li>
     </ol>

    <h2 class="sea_body underline"><span>Observations and Insights</span></h2>     
     <p class="sea_body upper_pad">The evidence versus the sceientific framework is as follows:</p>
